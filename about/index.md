Hi I'm Jason,

Currently a Software Engineer at a defense contractor called Leidos, targeting an embedded platform for an application geared towards deep sea acoustic energy propogation. 

Professionally I use C, C++, MATLAB, and python for agile work. Outside of work, I read hackernews, go to meetups, read technical books, play tennis, and hack away at new projects.
